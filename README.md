You must have installed the "discord" and subprocess libraries "pip install discord" and "pip install subprocess".

You have to put the index.py in your Minecraft server folder. Then, change the bot token to your own. Also change the path to the .jar
Once you have done this, run it and set !open. This will start the server by itself. This can also be done by everyone on the Discord server.

The commands available at the moment are:
!open to open the server.
!status to see the status of the server.
